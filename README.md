# Overview project
In the Udacity project 1 project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

# App Functionality
In this application, the home page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

Currently Reading
Want to Read
Read

# Search function
The home page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library. Just click "+" for search books(on the bottom left) from database.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
